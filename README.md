# Geophysical Survey of Nkong Field, Nigeria

## Project Overview
The Geophysical Survey at Nkong Field, Nigeria, was conducted to assess the subsurface features and geological properties of the seabed in preparation for future operations. The survey involved the use of geophysical tools to collect data on the seabed and subsurface conditions, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the area.

## Project Details
- **Date:** September 2023/2 Weeks
- **Role:** Data Processor
- **Client:** NK70
- **Vessel:** Batoil Beagle One
- **Project Location**: N70 and Mobil Field

## Responsibilities
-  Ensured the proper operation and configuration of survey equipment, including **EIVA NaviPac**, **Hypack 2018**, **C-Nav DGPS**, and **TSS Meridian Gyro**, to facilitate accurate data collection during the survey.

-  Monitored incoming data from multiple geophysical sensors including the **single beam echosounder**, **side scan sonar**, **magnetometer**, and **sub-bottom profiler**, ensuring completeness, accuracy, and quality of data captured during the survey.

-   Regularly backed up raw survey data to prevent potential loss, ensuring data security and integrity throughout the survey process.

-  Integrated datasets from various sensors (such as echosounders, sonars, magnetometers) into a unified **geophysical database**, allowing for efficient data analysis and reporting.

-  Performed initial quality control checks on the collected data using **Hypack 2018** and **EIVA NaviPac**, identifying and rectifying any anomalies, inconsistencies, or errors to ensure the highest data quality.

-  Verified the calibration of sensors, including the **Valeport SVP MIDAS** (for accurate sound velocity profiles) and **DMS Motion Sensor** (for motion corrections), to ensure precision in data collection and analysis.

## Equipment/Software Used
- **EIVA NaviPac:** Used for real-time positioning, navigation, and data logging during survey operations.
- **Hypack 2018:** Survey planning, data collection, processing, and management software used for geophysical surveys.
- **C-Nav DGPS:** Differential GPS system providing high-precision positioning for accurate surface measurements.
- **TSS Meridian Gyro:** Used for vessel heading and orientation, ensuring accurate navigation and positioning.
- **Single Beam Echosounder:** Used to capture bathymetric data for measuring depth and seabed topography.
- **Side Scan Sonar:** Employed to produce high-resolution imagery of the seabed, aiding in the detection of submerged features.
- **Magnetometer:** Detects metallic objects on or below the seabed, useful in identifying pipeline routes, cables, and other buried infrastructure.
- **Sub-bottom Profiler:** Provides insight into the seabed's sub-surface layers, helping to identify geological structures and anomalies.
- **Total Station:** Used for accurate terrestrial survey measurements and positioning tasks on land and at the survey site.
- **AutoCAD:** CAD software used for the creation of survey maps, visualizing survey data, and generating technical drawings.
- **DMS Motion Sensor:** Provides compensation for motion in dynamic conditions, ensuring the accuracy of sensor data.
- **Valeport SVP MIDAS:** Measures sound velocity in the water column to correct depth measurements and enhance data precision.
